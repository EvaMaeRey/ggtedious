# Welcome to the ggtedious workshop\!

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

Letâ€™s build a cool ggplot2 extension function. And then letâ€™s put it in
a package. And test\! Maybe it will be tedious, but more fun in good
company?

> â€˜Testing your code can be painful and tedious, but it greatly
> increases the quality of your code.â€™ - testthat introduction (probably
> Hadley Wickham)

In this workshop, weâ€™ll build and strengthen package building and test
writing muscles.

<!-- 'Error messages are a huge part of your user interface.  I mean you'd like to think they aren't, but they they are. - https://youtu.be/5LktoXh7WvY?si=bIYS6NLYrGey8o_7&t=2248 -->

<!-- Building a simple, straightforward extension in good company (workshop!) will provide a misery-loves-company occasion to build a correct package and build/strengthen testing muscles.  -->

<https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/>

Meeting objectives:

<!-- 0. My pre-step: Figure out what best practices for ggplot2 extension packages and testing are; and/or figure out some experts to ask for help. -->

1.  Practice a `compute_group` easy geom extension by creating
    geom\_post().
2.  Put them in a package using best practices.
3.  Meet like-minded stats educators, ggplot2 extenders, and package
    developers.

Prerequisite:

Having written a â€˜compute groupâ€™ geom extension. See:
<https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/2022-01-03-easy-geom-recipes/easy_geom_recipes.html>
Seasoned R/ggplot2 users mostly spent \~ 15 minutes on each recipe.

# Part 1. Work on functionality

## Step 0. Do it with base ggplot2 *can become problem statement later*

``` r
prize_wheel <- data.frame(probs = c(.7, .2, .1), payout = c(0, 1, 5))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(prize_wheel) + 
  aes(x = payout, y = probs) + 
  geom_point() + 
  aes(xend = payout, yend = 0) + 
  geom_segment()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/use_base_ggplot2-1.png)<!-- -->

## Step 0.b Write like-to-have code *code chunk option eval = F*

``` r
# would show just line
ggplot(prize_wheel) + 
  aes(x = payout, y = probs) + 
  geom_post()

# line and dot
ggplot(prize_wheel) + 
  aes(x = payout, y = probs) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_lollipop()
```

## Step 1. Write compute group function and test

reference:
<https://evamaerey.github.io/mytidytuesday/2022-01-03-easy-geom-recipes/easy_geom_recipes.html>

## Step 2. Pass to ggproto object

## Step 3. Write geom\_post() functions

## Step 3.1 Bonus, write geom\_lollipop with list mechanism

``` r
geom_lollipop <- function(...){

  list(  
  geom_post(...),
  geom_point(...)
  )
  
}
```

## Step 4. Test it out enjoy\! (possibly basis of examples and tests)

## Step 5. Write messages/warnings etc in the function

# Part II. Packaging and documentation ðŸš§ âœ…

## Phase 1. Minimal working package

### Bit A. Created package archetecture, running `devtools::create(".")` in interactive session. ðŸš§ âœ…

``` r
devtools::create(".")
```

### Bit B. Added roxygen skeleton? ðŸš§ âœ…

Use a roxygen skeleton for auto documentation and making sure proposed
functions are *exported*. Generally, early on, I donâ€™t do much
(anything) in terms of filling in the skeleton for documentation,
because things may change.

### Bit C. Managed dependencies ? ðŸš§ âœ…

Package dependencies managed, i.e.Â `depend::function()` in proposed
functions and declared in the DESCRIPTION

``` r
usethis::use_package("ggplot2")
```

### Bit D. Moved functions R folder? ðŸš§ âœ…

Use new {readme2pkg} function to do this from readmeâ€¦

``` r
library(tidyverse)
readme2pkg::chunk_to_r("geom_post")
```

### Bit E. Run `devtools::check()` and addressed errors. ðŸš§ âœ…

``` r
devtools::check(pkg = ".")
```

### Bit F. Build package ðŸš§ âœ…

``` r
devtools::build()
```

### Bit G. Write traditional README that uses built package (also serves as a test of build. ðŸš§ âœ…

The goal of the {ggtedious} package is to make it easy to draw posts
(and to learn about package building and testing)

Install package with:

    remotes::install_github("EvaMaeRey/ggtedious")

Once functions are exported you can remove go to two colons, and when
things are are really finalized, then go without colons (and rearrange
your readmeâ€¦)

``` r
library(ggtedious)  
```

### Bit H. Chosen a license? ðŸš§ âœ…

``` r
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

### Bit I. Add lifecycle badge (experimental) ðŸš§ âœ…

``` r
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")
```

## Phase 2: Listen & iterate ðŸš§ âœ…

Try to get feedback from experts on API, implementation, default
decisions. Is there already work that solves this problem?

## Phase 3: Let things settle

### Bit A. Settle on examples. Put them in the roxygen skeleton and readme. ðŸš§ âœ…

### Bit B. Written formal tests of functions and save to test that folders ðŸš§ âœ…

That would look like thisâ€¦

``` r
library(testthat)

test_that("calc times 2 works", {
  expect_equal(times_two(4), 8)
  expect_equal(times_two(5), 10)
  
})
```

``` r
readme2pkg::chunk_to_tests_testthat("test_calc_times_two_works")
```

### Bit C. Added a description and author information in the DESCRIPTION file ðŸš§ âœ…

### Bit D. Addressed *all* notes, warnings and errors. ðŸš§

## Phase 4. Promote to wider audienceâ€¦

### Bit A. Package website built? âœ…

``` r
usethis::use_pkgdown()
pkgdown::build_site()
```

### Bit B. Package website deployed? ðŸš§ âœ…

## Phase 5: Harden/commit

### Submit to CRAN/RUniverse? ðŸš§

# Appendix: Reports, Environment

## Edited Description file?

``` r
readLines("DESCRIPTION")
```
