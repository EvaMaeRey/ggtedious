Quoting the testthat package:

> â€˜Testing your code can be painful and tedious, but it greatly
> increases the quality of your code. testthat tries to make testing as
> fun as possible, so that you get a visceral satisfaction from writing
> tests. Testing should be addictive, so you do it all the time.â€™

I still feel like itâ€™s essentially not fun, but maybe in good company it
can be better.

Building a simple, straightforward extension provide a fun occasion to
build out testing muscles.

geom\_post and geom\_lollipop might work well. After building those
functions, we can add tests, error messages, etc.

Meeting objectives:

0.  My prestep: Figure out what best practices for ggplot2 extension
    packages are; figure out some experts to ask for help.

At meeting:

1.  Write ggplot2 extension functions geom\_post() geom\_lollipop().
2.  Put them in a package using best practices.
3.  meet like minded stats educators\!

# Part 1. Work on functionality

## Step 0. Do it with base ggplot2 (can become problem statement later)

``` r
prize_wheel <- data.frame(probs = c(.7, .2, .1), payout = c(0, 1, 5))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(prize_wheel) + 
  aes(x = payout, y = probs) + 
  geom_point() + 
  aes(xend = payout, yend = 0) + 
  geom_segment()
```

## Step 1. Write compute group function and test

reference:

## Step 2. Pass to ggproto object

## Step 3. Write geom\_\*() functions

## Step 4. Test it out enjoy\! (possibly basis of examples and tests)

## Step 5. Formalize tests, write messages.

``` r
testthat::test_that("multiplication works", {
  testthat::expect_equal(2*2, 4)
})
#> Test passed ðŸŒˆ
```

# Part 2. Build out package

## 1\. devtools::create

## 2\. Send functions to .R folder and Tests to test\_that folder (or copy and paste).

``` r
library(readme2pkg)
chunk_to_r("geom_lollipop")
chunk_to_tests_testthat("test1")
```

## 3\. devtools::check

## 4\. Install and restart

## Done\!
